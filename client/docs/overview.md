## Intro

Aim of this document is to provide a bit of an overview to the new frontend
stack. The technologies being used, motivations for using them, some of
the conventions in place. There is also `style_conventions.md` that will
explicitly list out conventions and styles we are using and that should be
followed to keep our frontend code base clean and organized.
